# Minetest mod: bright_night
Seamlessly overrides night time minimum sunlight level for all players to provide more visibility outdoors without affecting cave lighting or gameplay.

By default the minimum sunlight level is set to 4, but you can change this in the script with some effort. (The transition timestamps need to be recalculated.)

Does _not_ play nicely with other skybox mods at the moment.
